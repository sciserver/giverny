giverny - stable release version 2.2.5 (13 May 2024)
    - package for querying Johns Hopkins Turbulence Database (JHTDB) datasets.

version 2.2.5 updates:
    - removed tqdm from the givernylocal package dependency list in the README.
version 2.2.4 updates:
    - fixed README SciServer hyperlinks.
version 2.2.3 updates:
    - added time series queries as one call to the backend code, rather than separate calls for each
      timepoint in the series.
version 2.2.2 updates:
    - fixed import dependency in turbulence_toolkit.py
    - moved dask cluster creation to turbulence_toolkit.py to fix bottleneck with pchip interpolation and
      visitor points.
    - creation of givernylocal PyPI package.
version 2.2.1 updates:
    - creation of giverny PyPI package.
version 2.1.12 updates:
    - add package __init__.py files.
version 2.1.11 updates:
    - updated giverny package metadata.
version 2.1.10 updates:
    - fixed timepoints for the discrete time index datasets processed by pyJHTDB.
      - isotropic4096, rotstrat4096, and channel5200
    - simplified dask cluster and client code.
version 2.1.9 updates:
    - reverted dask cluster and client creation, and shutdown, to when a query is made.
      - preserves compute resources.
      - fixes issue when running the notebook in a REST container.
version 2.1.8 updates:
    - removed SciServer.Authentication package.
    - changed local pickled metadata folder path.
version 2.1.7 updates:
    - code cleanup.
    - updated linear interpolation function names for the sabl datasets.
version 2.1.6 updates:
    - simplified error checking for getCutout.
    - added documentation differentiating time points and snapshot number for different datasets.
    - changed first "timepoint" to 1 for snapshot number datasets in getData to keep consistent with getCutout.
    - updated memory limit for the dask localcluster to handle the increased maximum cutout size.
version 2.1.5 updates:
    - removed check to shutdown the cluster and client in the dask monitoring function if 1 or more
      of the workers closes unexpectedly.
version 2.1.4 updates:
    - fixed chunk volume calculation in getData pre-processing.
version 2.1.3 updates:
    - removed python packages that no longer needed to be imported in some files.
    - small performance improvement to the getData visitor read function.
version 2.1.2 updates:
    - fixed dask localcluster and client to close after 5 minutes of idle time in order to free up
      allocated compute resources when not in use.
      - the dask client will stay running up to 2 hours during processing. all queries should finish
        well under 2 hours, but if an exception occurs during processing then the cluster will automatically
        close if the python kernel remains alive and no other queries are made within 2 hours.
version 2.1.1 updates:
    - built getData and getCutout functions for querying all datasets.
    - added stable atmospheric boundary layer ("sabl") datasets and z-axis linear step-down interpolation methods
      to handle them.
version 1.2.7 updates:
    - added user interface for choosing how to save output files.
    - reformatted interpolation/differentiation output to match legacy code.
    - added automatic metadata file generation.
    - fixed stale variable states when using a dask cluster for concurrent processing.
    - simplified example point distributions for interpolation queries.
    - added documentation to the user-interface.
version 1.2.6 updates:
    - added documentation to the user interface.
    - mapped fully overlapped chunk groups for interpolation buckets together.
version 1.2.5 updates:
    - added getGradient, getHessian, and getLaplacian functions.
    - added .xmf file generation for getCutout.
version 1.2.4 updates:
    - simplified the metadata files and switched them to be stored on a fileDB node.
    - fixed HTML documentation in the notebook.
version 1.2.3 updates:
    - removed h5py package.
    - updated HDF5 output file formatting for getCutout.
      - updated contour plotting and data retrieval functions compatability with xarray.
    - updated filepathing to reflect new distribution of iso8192 zarr data on fileDB.
version 1.2.2 updates:
    - removed "import mmap".
version 1.2.1 updates:
    - converted the notebook to process zarr files instead of binary files.
    - simplified getCutout, getPressure, and getVelocity functions.
version 1.1.4 updates:
    - added 'lag4', 'lag6', 'lag8', 'm1q4', and 'm2q8' interpolation methods.
version 1.1.3 updates:
    - code simplifications.
    - removed worker sorting for dask parallel processing.
    - updated the pickled file directory to a folder in "scratch".
version 1.1.2 updates:
    - implemented memory map for reading the voxels.
    - removed pre-processing step of grouping morton-adjacent voxels that overlap the user-specified box.
    - simplified identifying database files the user-specified box is in.
    - added creating pickle files for the database filepaths and SQL metadata.
    - adjusted the contour plot axes ticks to be centered for each datapoint.
    - added load balancing for dask worker assignment.
    - fully vectorized the reading of the database files.
version 1.1.1 updates:
